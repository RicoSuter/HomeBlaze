		"reset": "Launch the Powerley app. From the navigation menu, select My Devices (Device icon), select Energy Bridge. On the Energy Bridge tab, scroll to \"Z-Wave\", and select \"Reset Network\", and on the next screen, tap \"Begin Z-Wave Network Reset\". A warning will display alerting the user that this will reset the network and disconnect all devices and to only use in the event the network or device is no longer operable. The screen will then ask the user to confirm by typing \"RESET\" to complete the factory reset.\n\nIf this controller is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network. If this controller is being used as a secondary controller in the network, use this procedure to reset this controller only in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable",
