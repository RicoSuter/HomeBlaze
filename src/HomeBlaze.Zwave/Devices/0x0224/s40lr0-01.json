		"reset": "If this controller is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network. If this controller is being used as a secondary controller in the network, use this procedure to reset this controller only in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable. In order to factory reset your Z-Wave network, go to Settings > Devices > Choose your Base > Open Advanced Settings and then select Z-wave Reset Controller. After a few seconds, the Base will beep to indicate that your Z-Wave network has been reset. Any devices which were part of your Z-Wave network will need to be reset before they can be re-added. Use the Z-Wave General Exclusion menu under Settings > Devices > Choose your Base > Open Advanced Settings to do this",
