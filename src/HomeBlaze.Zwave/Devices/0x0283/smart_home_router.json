Once confirmed, the SR20 will transmit a Device Reset Locally Notification to all connected devices. The SR20 will then clear all network and user settings and reboot into a factory.\n\nNote: \nIf this controller is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network. If this controller is being used as a secondary controller in the network, use this procedure to reset this controller only in the event that the network primary controller is missing or otherwise inoperable\n\nRefer the relevant support information from the \nonline support section of the www.tp-link.com website \nor download the latest TP-LINK Kasa App from \nPlay Store for Android devices or Apple Store for\niOS devices",
