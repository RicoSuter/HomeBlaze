When the factory reset is completed, the first and second LEDs will be turned on again. \nIf it not work, then press and hold the gateway ENT button for 10 seconds or more. \n\nNote:\nIf this controller is the primary controller for your network, resetting it will result in the nodes in your network being orphaned and it will be necessary after the reset to exclude and re-include all of the nodes in the network.",
